# Search Github

## Overview
Explore Github to find user's repositories and all their branches

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Run server and view project at localhost:8080
```
npm run serve
```

## Future improvements
- Setup routing in project
- Have a select menu when searching for users with users that match the searched term. This would make use of the search section of the github api.
